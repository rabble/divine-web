                    Divine is an independent short-form video app inspired by Vine's creative 6-second format.
                    It allows you to create and share looping videos using the decentralized Nostr protocol,
                    making your content censorship-resistant and truly owned by you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike traditional social media platforms, Divine doesn't store your data on centralized
                    servers. Instead, it uses the Nostr protocol to distribute your content across a network
                    of independent relays.

                  <p className="font-semibold">
                    Divine has no affiliation with X (formerly Twitter) or the original Vine platform.

                    Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol that
                    enables censorship-resistant social media. Instead of storing data on one company's servers,
                    Nostr distributes content across many independent relays.

                    Your account is just a public/private key pair - no email, phone number, or personal

                    Yes! We're currently beta testing a username registration system that allows you to
                    claim a human-readable address like username@divine.video (also known as a NIP-05 identifier).

                  <p>
                    A NIP-05 identifier is an email-like address that makes it easier for people to find and
                    verify you on Nostr. Instead of sharing a long public key (npub), you can share
                    username@divine.video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Is it required?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No! This is completely optional. Most users don't need a NIP-05 identifier to use Divine.
                    Your Nostr public key works perfectly fine for posting, following, and interacting on the platform.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The username registration system is currently in beta testing. If you're interested in
                    claiming a username@divine.video address, stay tuned for announcements about when
                    registration opens to all users.

                    <strong>Yes!</strong> You can delete any video you've posted and edit your video records

                  <p>
                    <strong>How deletion works:</strong> When you delete a video, Divine removes it from our
                    systems and sends a deletion request to all Nostr relays. Most relays honor these deletion
                    requests. However, because Nostr is decentralized, some relays may retain copies - this is
                    the trade-off for a censorship-resistant platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Editing metadata:</strong> You can update your video's information (title, description,
                    hashtags) by editing the event record. Changes will propagate across the Nostr network.

                    On the original Vine, only Vine employees could curate lists for categories and

                  <p>
                    Lists use Nostr's NIP-51 (Lists) protocol, making them decentralized and portable
                    across different Nostr clients. Your lists belong to you and can be accessed from
                    any compatible app.

                  <p>
                    This democratization of curation means the best collections are built by passionate
                    community members, not just platform employees!

                      Our community helps identify AI-generated content through our reporting system.
                      When users report content as AI-generated, those reports are shared with your followers
                      through our composable moderation system, creating trust networks for content filtering.

                      prove they were captured on a real phone camera, not generated by AI. ProofMode creates
                      verifiable signatures that confirm the video's authenticity.

                    ProofMode is a system for cryptographically proving that videos were captured

                  <p>
                    Relays are servers that store and distribute Nostr events. Think of them like
                    email servers - they relay your messages to others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Divine uses specific relays optimized for video content, but you can configure
                    your own relay list if you prefer. Using multiple relays ensures your content
                    stays available even if one relay goes down.

                    <strong>Yes - this is a priority feature we're building!</strong> One of the major problems
                    with the original Vine was that there was no way for Viners to make money from their content.
                    This led many creators to leave the platform, contributing to Vine's eventual shutdown.

                    Divine fixes this fundamental problem. Because you're in control of your account and content

                    in the app to host their content.

                    and many other Nostr clients. Your profile and follows sync across all of them.

                    Divine is <strong>not</strong> a blockchain, cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, or "Web3" project.
                    While Divine uses the Nostr protocol (a decentralized communication protocol), it has nothing
                    to do with cryptocurrency, NFTs, or blockchain technology. It's simply a video sharing platform
                    that gives you control over your content.
