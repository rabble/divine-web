## Project Notes

**Divine Web: Human-Made Badge Integration**

Files created:
- src/components/NoAIBadge.tsx - Badge component with Link to info page
- src/pages/HumanCreatedPage.tsx - Comprehensive info page explaining certification

Files modified:
- src/AppRouter.tsx - Added /human-created route
- src/components/VideoCard.tsx - Badge display logic and import
- CHANGELOG.md - Documented new feature

Badge appears for:
1. All videos with vineId (migrated Vines from 2013-2017)
2. Videos with "human-created" in hashtags array (user-claimed)

The badge links to /human-created which explains:
- What the badge means
- When it appears (automatic vs user-claimed)
- How it relates to ProofMode
- How creators can claim certification
- Credits no-ai-icon.com movement

Good example of combining automatic verification (historical data) with opt-in certification (trust-based tagging) to build a more transparent platform.
