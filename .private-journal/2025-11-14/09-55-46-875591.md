## Project Notes

Completed full release cycle for Divine:
1. Added iOS beta test announcement (10k signups) with TechCrunch link
2. Reduced video loading flash by replacing bright Skeleton components with dark bg-black/80 + subtle spinner
3. Removed three demo cards from landing page (Authentic, Verified, Decentralized)
4. Fixed links to not open in new tabs
5. Updated CHANGELOG.md
6. Committed and pushed to GitHub (main branch)
7. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages successfully - https://f11dba0a.divine-web-fm8.pages.dev

User was frustrated with intense video flashing and wanted cleaner landing page. All changes tested and deployed successfully.
