## Project Notes

Fixed video loading flash issue in Divine. User complained about intense flashing during video load. Replaced bright Skeleton components with dark bg-black/80 backgrounds + subtle spinner in VideoPlayer, VideoFeed, and VideoGrid. Also removed target="_blank" from TechCrunch link per user request to not open new tabs. Tests pass.
