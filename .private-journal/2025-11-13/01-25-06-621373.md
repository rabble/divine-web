## Project Notes

Fixed Divine Web reconnection error messaging and made Search public:

**Problem 1 - Reconnection Errors Too Prominent:**
- Large red "Reconnection Failed" toast was alarming users
- Users thought it was a critical error when they could still browse content fine
- Only affects signing capability (posting, liking, etc.), not browsing

**Solution:**
1. Removed "Reconnection Failed" destructive toast (line 131-135 in KeycastAutoConnect.tsx)
   - Now just logs to console instead of showing scary red error
   - Users can still browse, and if they try to sign something they'll get a contextual error then
2. Removed "Reconnection Slow" timeout toast (lines 66-72)
   - Was showing after 30 seconds, also overly alarming
   - Connection happens in background, users don't need to be warned

**Changes in KeycastAutoConnect.tsx:**
- Removed setTimeout for slow connection warning
- Removed clearTimeout call
- Replaced final reconnection failure toast with console.warn
- Kept "Session Expired" toast (legitimate error needing user action)
- Kept "Connected!" success toast (positive feedback)

**Problem 2 - Search Missing from Header:**
- Search was only visible to logged-in users
- Should be available for everyone to use

**Solution:**
1. Updated AppHeader.tsx to show Search for all users (moved outside user && check)
2. Updated AppRouter.tsx to make /search a public route (moved from protected to public section)

**Current Header Navigation:**
- **Public (all users):** Hashtags, Search
- **Protected (logged in only):** Lists

**Reasoning:**
- Search is a discovery tool - logged-out users should be able to find content
- Lists are personal collections - require login
- Most browsing features are now public, login only required for posting/liking/personal features

All tests pass successfully.
