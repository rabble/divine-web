## Project Notes

Redesigned Divine Web Open Source page to focus on beta testing:

**Key Changes:**

1. **Updated Overview Section**:
   - Renamed to "Beta Testing Now Live!"
   - Emphasized beta status prominently
   - Added clear call-to-action box with 4 ways to join:
     * iOS: TestFlight Beta link
     * Android: Google Play Beta link
     * Mac: Native macOS app (coming soon note)
     * Web: Link to start exploring (you're already here)

2. **Simplified Platforms Section**:
   - Renamed to "Available Platforms"
   - Removed Windows and Linux entries (as requested)
   - Only shows 4 platforms:
     * Web App: "Live" badge
     * macOS: "Available" badge
     * iOS: "Beta" badge
     * Android: "Beta" badge

3. **Removed Redundancy**:
   - Removed separate beta testing callout (info now in overview)
   - Removed unused ExternalLink icon import

**Result**: More focused page that clearly communicates beta status and makes it easy for users to join via their preferred platform (iOS, Android, Mac, or web).

All tests pass successfully.
