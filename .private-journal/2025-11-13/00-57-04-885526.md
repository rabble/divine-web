## Project Notes

Enabled logged-out browsing experience for Divine Web:

**Key Changes:**

1. **Routing Updates (AppRouter.tsx)**:
   - Created new "Public browsing routes" section
   - Made these routes accessible without login:
     * `/discovery` - Browse all videos
     * `/trending` - Trending videos
     * `/hashtags` - Hashtag discovery
     * `/hashtag/:tag` - Videos by hashtag
     * `/t/:tag` - Videos by tag
     * `/profile/:npub` - User profiles
     * `/video/:id` - Individual video pages
     * `/u/:userId` - Universal user pages
     * `/:nip19` - NIP-19 identifier routes
   
   - Kept these as protected (login required):
     * `/home` - Following feed (user-specific)
     * `/search` - Search functionality
     * `/lists` - User lists
     * `/list/:pubkey/:listId` - List details

2. **Landing Page Updates (LandingPage.tsx)**:
   - Added prominent "Start Exploring" button (primary CTA)
   - Links to `/discovery` for immediate browsing
   - Moved "Join the Beta Test" to secondary position
   - Styled as large button with bg-primary color

**User Flow:**
- Logged-out users see landing page on `/`
- Click "Start Exploring" → `/discovery` to browse videos
- Can view videos, profiles, hashtags without login
- Login required only for personalized features (home feed, lists, search)

**Benefits:**
- Lowers barrier to entry - users can try before signing up
- Demonstrates value immediately
- Nostr login only required for personalized/interactive features

All tests pass successfully.
